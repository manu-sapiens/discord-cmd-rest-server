adventure_hook: "The party finds themselves on a dusty road leading away from the village of Stony Brook. Behind them lies the village with its welcoming tavern, The Sleeping Dragon, while ahead the road winds into a dense forest. Recent travelers have warned of goblin raids in the area, and a passing merchant mentioned that the village elder has posted a reward for dealing with the menace. The party can either head to the tavern to gather more information from the locals or follow the forest path where villagers claim to have seen goblin tracks."
rumors:
  - "The goblins have been raiding the village at night."
  - "The goblins are led by a powerful shaman named Yart."
  - "The goblins have been stealing food and supplies."
