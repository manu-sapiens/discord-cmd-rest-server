    description: "In a clearing in the forest, the party finds the entrance to the goblin caves. The entrance is a dark hole in the ground with a dim light flickering inside barely visible. A crude tripwire trap is set up near the entrance. The tripwire has a DC of 10 to notice. If the tripwire is triggered, a small bell will ring in room_1, alerting the goblins inside. The party can disarm the trap with a DC 10 Dexterity check. If the alarm is not triggered and the party does not make too much noise, they can enter Room_1 with the goblin still asleep. If the alarm is triggered, the goblin will wake up and shout for reinforcements and then wait inside Room_1 to attack the party when they enter."

Light from a campfire in room_2 provides dim illumination. The regular_goblin will wake up if attacked or if the DM judges that the party is being noisy (talking among themselves, casting spells, etc.) in this room. If the regular_goblin shouts out, the listed reinforcements will be spawned and join the fight."
